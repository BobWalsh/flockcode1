### Notes
1. Using ngrok on Mac OS Sierra. Since you are downloading ngrok from an unrecognized developer, you will need to go to preferences>>Security and manually approve this executable. Then copy it into a directory in your path, like /usr/local/bin, and then it will work. Otherwise, expect to see -bash: /usr/local/bin/ngrok: Permission denied.
2. https://docs.flock.co/display/flockos/Handling+App+Installs+and+Tokens could be a little more clear: you need the ngrok https for the base-url, then amend /events and use that to populate under the field Event Listener URL in *Creating A Flock App*.
3. Also in that form, *Guide for creating Memorable App icon* is an empty link/returns your flock app once that is saved.
