### Notes
1. Using ngrok on Mac OS Sierra. Since you are downloading ngrok from an unrecognized developer, you will need to go to preferences>>Security and manually approve this executable. Then copy it into a directory in your path, like /usr/local/bin, and then it will work. Otherwise, expect to see -bash: /usr/local/bin/ngrok: Permission denied.
